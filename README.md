# Project Description

This project focuses on fetching real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and visualizing the temperature trends using Python. It retrieves data for a given city, extracts the temperature values for different timestamps, and then plots a graph using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Important Features & Concepts Used

API Integration - Fetching real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library.

JSON Data Handling - Parsing and extracting relevant data from the JSON response.

Data Visualization - Representing temperature trends using line charts.

User Interaction - Taking user input for a personalized experience.

Exception Handling - Ensuring smooth API response handling.

# Libraries Used & Their Purpose

requests: Used to send HTTP requests and fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API.

matplotlib.pyplot: Helps in creating visualizations like line graphs.

seaborn: Enhances visual aesthetics of the graphs.

json: Parses JSON responses from the API.
